        <h2>A little to know about me.</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Washington State and I have one older brother and two older sisters. I have worked many different kinds of jobs ranging from a paper boy at 10 years old to restaurant work, automotive work, grocery industry, and the high tech industry of semi-conductor manufacturing.</p>
        <p>I decided to take the opportunity to explore computer coding after moving here to Oregon before going back to work full time and see if this would be something that I could continue with as a carrier or just to have a littel more knowledge prior to taking the class.
        </p>
        <p>My current hobbies are a little limited at the time but I like to go snow skiing, biking, hiking, fishing, and swiming, and enjoy going to the gym.</p>
